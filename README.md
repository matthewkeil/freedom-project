  decentralized/democratized socail interaction

  As a group, we are a smart people that do amazing things. With that in mind,
there has got to be a better way to do "this government thing." This project
is meant to figure out what that means. Right now it seems impossible, but how
do we get somewhere if we aren't even really sure where it is we need to go,
no less how to get there? I don't purport to have the answers and no one person
can.  This is where freedom;project; steps in. It is meant to, at a minimum,
help us figure out a direction to start heading. Interest in being part of a 
more perfect union are all that are required to join.

hello and welcome to,
  - we the people
